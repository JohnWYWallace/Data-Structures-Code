# Data Structures Examples
This file is a few of projects i did in my Data Structures class while i was in University. 
This includes insertion sort, merge sort and a way to sort user IDs.

There are three projects in this repo: 
 - Insertion Sort Project
 - Merge Sort Project
 - A User ID Sorting Project
